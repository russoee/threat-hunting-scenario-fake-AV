# Threat Hunting Case Study: BitSentinelCore Fake Antivirus Attack

This project documents a full threat hunting investigation using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Kusto Query Language (KQL) to uncover a simulated malware scenario. It follows the attackerâ€™s actions from compiling and executing a fake antivirus binary to achieving stealthy persistence and triggering keylogging behavior through deceptive shortcut files.

## Scenario Summary

A malicious binary named `BitSentinelCore.exe` was locally compiled on the host using `csc.exe`. The user (4nth0ny!) unknowingly launched the file, triggering a chain of persistence mechanisms:

* Registry Run key (`HKCU\...\Run\BitSecSvc`)
* Scheduled task (`schtasks` with UpdateHealthTelemetry)
* Decoy file drop (`ThreatMetrics`)
* Shortcut-based reactivation (`systemreport.lnk`)

This project reconstructs the entire attack chain and highlights the techniques used to maintain access and avoid detection.
